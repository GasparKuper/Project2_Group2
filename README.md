## The capabilities of our program
1) Representation of the solar system (GUI)  <br />
   To represent the solar system, we use coordinates that we get using solvers and then scale them to allow a better visualization on the screen.
   
3) Calculate the trajectory of the probe and planets<br />
   We have two options:
   1) You can start the GUI and run solvers with our parameters.
   2) You can start the console and run the program with your parameters.
   <br />
   For calculation, we can use 4 solvers: <br />
   <br />
   1) Implicit Euler <br />
   2) Symplectic Euler <br />
   3) Velocity-Verlet (Leapfrog-Verlet implementation) <br />
   4) 4th order Runge-Kutta <br />
   
4) Calculate the initial velocity of the probe <br />
   Our program calculates the optimal initial velocity to reach Titan.
   
5) Compare coordinates with NASA coordinates <br />
   We can compare the coordinates of the probe and planets calculated by our program with the ones from NASA horizons. Then, the program can represent this comparison using  line charts.
