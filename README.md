# Project2_Group10
The capabilities of our program: 
1) Representation of the solar system (GUI) 
   For representation, we use solver and then scale these coordinates for the visualization on the screen)
   
3) Calculate the trajectory of the probe and planets
   We have two options:
   1) You can start the GUI and run solvers with our parameters.
   2) You can start the console and run the program with yours parameters.
For calculation, we can use 4 solvers: 
   1) Implicit Euler
   2) Symplectic Euler
   3) Velocity-Verlet (Leapfrog-Verlet implementation)
   4) 4th order Runge-Kutta
   
4) Calculate the initial velocity fo the probe
   Program calculates the initial velocity in which probe reaches the Titan
   
5) Compare coordinates with NASA coordinates
   We can compare coordinates of the probe and planets, which program calculates, then program can represent the comparison our coordinates and NASA coordinates on line charts
